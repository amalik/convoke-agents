## What is Convoke?

Convoke extends AI agents with installable modules. **Teams** bring new agents for a domain. **Skills** add new capabilities to existing agents. Both are independent — install them separately or combine them.

Each team is a self-contained group of conversational agents that guide you through a structured process. Each skill patches new workflows onto agents you already have, without modifying them.

| Module | Type | What it does | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| [Vortex](#vortex--product-discovery-team) | Team | Product discovery — 7 agents, 22 workflows | Available |
| [Gyre](#gyre--operational-readiness-team) | Team | Operational readiness — 4 agents, 7 workflows | Coming soon |
| [Forge](#forge--domain-knowledge-extraction-team) | Team | Domain knowledge extraction for brownfield projects | Coming soon |
| [Enhance](#enhance--agent-skills) | Skill | Agent capability upgrades — RICE backlog management | Available |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git
- Claude Code or Claude.ai

### Install

```bash
npm install convoke-agents && npx -p convoke-agents convoke-install-vortex
```

All 7 Vortex agents with 22 workflows are installed and ready to use. Something not working? Run `npx -p convoke-agents convoke-doctor` or check the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).

### Personalize

Open `_bmad/bme/_vortex/config.yaml` and replace `{user}` with your name. Agents use this to personalize their interactions.

### Activate an Agent

```

**Claude Code (terminal) / Other AI assistants**

```bash
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/contextualization-expert.md          # Emma  🎯
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/discovery-empathy-expert.md          # Isla  🔍

cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/production-intelligence-specialist.md # Noah  📡
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/learning-decision-expert.md          # Max   🧭
```

**Claude.ai**

Open any agent file from `_bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/` and paste its contents into your conversation.

**How activation works:** Each agent is a markdown file containing a full persona, menu system, and workflow instructions. When Claude reads the file, it adopts that agent's expertise and presents you with an interactive menu. Pick a workflow and follow the guided steps.

### Your First Session

1. **Personalize** — Edit `_bmad/bme/_vortex/config.yaml` and replace `{user}` with your name
2. **Activate Emma** — Use any activation method above
3. **See the menu** — Emma presents numbered options. Select **Lean Persona**
4. **Follow the steps** — Emma walks you through 6 guided steps, asking questions at each one
5. **Find your artifact** — Your lean persona is saved in `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/`
6. **Follow the Compass** — Emma's Vortex Compass suggests which agent to visit next based on what you learned

Each workflow ends with a Compass routing suggestion. You don't need to follow a linear path — the system guides you to whichever stream needs attention.

## Vortex — Product Discovery Team

**7 agents guide you from insight to evidence and back again — a continuous discovery loop, not a one-shot checklist**

[![Agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/agents-7-brightgreen)](docs/agents.md)
[![Workflows](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflows-22-success)](docs/agents.md)

Most teams skip validation and build on assumptions. Vortex guides you through seven discovery streams — from understanding your users to interpreting production signals — so you make evidence-based decisions before, during, and after you build.

```text
                         7 Streams · 7 Agents

          ▶ Start at Emma · back to any stream
```

*Each workflow ends with a Compass routing to whichever stream needs attention — you can start or return to any agent.*

| Agent | Stream | What they do |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Emma** 🎯 | Contextualize | Frame the right problem — personas, product vision, scope |
| **Isla** 🔍 | Empathize | Understand users — empathy maps, interviews, discovery research |
| **Mila** 🔬 | Synthesize | Converge research into clear problem definitions |
| **Liam** 💡 | Hypothesize | Turn problems into testable hypotheses and experiments |
| **Wade** 🧪 | Externalize | Test assumptions with MVPs, experiments, and prototypes |
| **Noah** 📡 | Sensitize | Interpret production signals, user behavior, and engagement patterns |
| **Max** 🧭 | Systematize | Capture learnings and decide: pivot, patch, or persevere |

### What Agents Produce

Here's a sample from the [full 7-agent journey example](_bmad-output/journey-examples/busy-parents-7-agent-journey.md) — a busy parents meal planning project run through all seven streams:

> **Emma** frames the Job-to-be-Done: *"Eliminate the daily 5:30 PM dinner decision so I can feed my family well without the mental load of planning, shopping, and deciding under time pressure."*
>
> **Liam** turns that into a testable hypothesis: *"We believe busy parents will act on a single dinner suggestion delivered at 4:00 PM within 3 minutes because the decision burden — not cooking — is their primary barrier."*
>
> **Max** captures the learning and recommends: *PATCH — the core hypothesis is validated; iterate on timing, don't pivot direction.*

**[See the full 7-agent journey →](_bmad-output/journey-examples/busy-parents-7-agent-journey.md)**

### Using the Agents

Each agent can be used independently or as part of the full Vortex flow:

1. **Emma (Contextualize)** — Start here when defining a new product or problem space
2. **Isla (Empathize)** — Start here when you need to understand users better
3. **Mila (Synthesize)** — Start here when you have research to converge
4. **Liam (Hypothesize)** — Start here when you have a problem and need testable hypotheses
5. **Wade (Externalize)** — Start here when you have hypotheses ready to test
6. **Noah (Sensitize)** — Start here when experiments have graduated to production
7. **Max (Systematize)** — Start here when you have results and need to decide next steps

Max's **Vortex Navigation** workflow identifies which stream needs attention based on evidence gaps. Every workflow ends with a **Vortex Compass** that routes you to the right next agent. Ten handoff contracts (HC1-HC10) ensure structured information flows between agents — see the [contracts directory](_bmad/bme/_vortex/contracts/) for details.

For detailed workflow descriptions, see the [Agent Guide](docs/agents.md) and individual user guides:

- [Emma User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/EMMA-USER-GUIDE.md) | [Isla User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/ISLA-USER-GUIDE.md) | [Mila User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/MILA-USER-GUIDE.md) | [Liam User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/LIAM-USER-GUIDE.md)
- [Wade User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/WADE-USER-GUIDE.md) | [Noah User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/NOAH-USER-GUIDE.md) | [Max User Guide](_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/MAX-USER-GUIDE.md)

## Gyre — Operational Readiness Team

**Coming soon** — 4 agents assess your project's operational readiness across observability, deployment, and compliance.

| Agent | Role | What they do |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Scout** 🔎 | Stack Detective | Scan your project and detect the technology stack |
| **Atlas** 📐 | Model Curator | Generate contextual capability models for your stack |
| **Lens** 🔬 | Readiness Analyst | Analyze gaps across observability, deployment, and compliance |
| **Coach** 🏋️ | Review Coach | Walk through findings, capture feedback, and prioritize a readiness backlog |

Gyre produces a RICE-scored readiness backlog tailored to your actual stack — not a generic checklist. Four contracts (GC1-GC4) structure the flow from stack detection through actionable recommendations.

---

## Forge — Domain Knowledge Extraction Team

**Coming soon** — Forge captures and codifies domain knowledge from brownfield projects. When a consultant or engineer lands on an existing codebase, Forge's agents extract what the system actually does, map it against what documentation claims, and produce structured knowledge artifacts.

Five agents work through two phases: **Silo** surveys the landscape and **Rune** excavates deep knowledge in Phase A, then **Aria** codifies findings, **Sage** validates accuracy, and **Warden** stewards knowledge freshness in later phases.

Forge and Gyre share handoff contracts — Forge's knowledge artifacts feed Gyre's contextual models, and Gyre's readiness gaps queue Forge investigations.

---

## Enhance — Agent Skills

**Add new capabilities to existing agents without modifying them**

[![Workflows](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflows-1-success)](_bmad/bme/_enhance/guides/ENHANCE-GUIDE.md)
[![Modes](https://img.shields.io/badge/modes-3-blue)](_bmad/bme/_enhance/workflows/initiatives-backlog/workflow.md)

Skills are the other half of Convoke's extensibility. While Teams bring new agents, Skills give existing agents new workflows — installed via menu patching, not agent modification.

### Initiatives Backlog (PM Agent)

The first Enhance skill adds RICE-scored backlog management to the PM agent. Three modes cover the full lifecycle:

```text
                    Initiatives Backlog

  ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
  │  [T] Triage │   │  [R] Review │   │  [C] Create │
  │  Ingest new │   │   Rescore   │   │  Bootstrap   │
  │  findings   │   │  existing   │   │  from scratch│
  └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘
         │                 │                 │
         ▼                 ▼                 ▼
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │          initiatives-backlog.md                   │
  │   RICE-scored · Categorized · Change-tracked     │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Triage** | Ingest review findings, extract actionable items, propose RICE scores with two-gate validation, append to existing backlog |
| **Review** | Walk through items one at a time, rescore where priorities have shifted, regenerate prioritized view |
| **Create** | Gather initiatives interactively, batch-score with RICE, generate a complete backlog from scratch |

#### Activate

The Enhance skill appears in the PM agent's menu after installation:

```text
[IB] Initiatives Backlog (Convoke Enhance)
```

Select it from the PM agent menu, or activate directly:

**Claude Code (skills)**

```text
/bmad-enhance-initiatives-backlog
```

**Claude Code (terminal) / Other AI assistants**

```bash
cat _bmad/bme/_enhance/workflows/initiatives-backlog/workflow.md
```

### Building Your Own Skills

The [Enhance Guide](_bmad/bme/_enhance/guides/ENHANCE-GUIDE.md) documents the complete pattern for creating new skills: directory structure, step file architecture, agent menu patching, config registration, and verification integration.

## How It Fits with BMAD Core

Convoke handles **discovery and validation**. BMAD Core handles **implementation**. Each module feeds the next — validated findings flow into implementation, production signals flow back.

```text
Convoke Modules                            BMAD Core
┌──────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐

│   Vortex (Product Discovery) │ ──────>  │ PM → Architect → Dev │
│   Gyre (Operational Readiness│ ──────>  │ "Let's build it"     │

│ Skills                       │  signals │                      │
│   Enhance (Agent Upgrades)   │ ──────>  │                      │
│   [Future skills]            │          │                      │
└──────────────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────┘
```

Teams and Skills are peer module types — both installable, both independent. Convoke works standalone or as an extension — no BMAD Method installation required.

---

## Updating

```bash
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-version          # Check current version
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-update --dry-run  # Preview changes
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-update            # Apply update (auto-backup)
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-doctor            # Diagnose issues
```

Your data in `_bmad-output/` is never touched. Automatic backups are created before every update.

> **Tip:** If `npx convoke-update` reports "Already up to date" but you know a newer version exists, npx may be serving a cached copy. Force the latest with:
> ```bash
> npx -p convoke-agents@latest convoke-update --yes
> ```

See [UPDATE-GUIDE.md](UPDATE-GUIDE.md) for migration paths and troubleshooting.
