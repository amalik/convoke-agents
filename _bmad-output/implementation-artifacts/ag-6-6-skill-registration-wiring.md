# Story 6.6: Skill Registration & Wiring

Status: done

## Story

As a Convoke maintainer publishing the Epic 6 release,
I want `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` and its two skills (`bmad-migrate-artifacts`, `bmad-portfolio-status`) to be installed, refreshed, and validated by the platform pipeline,
So that operators on a fresh `convoke-update` actually receive the new skills instead of an empty `.claude/skills/` for them.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a user runs `convoke-update` (or `convoke-install`) on a project that has the new package version **When** `refreshInstallation()` runs **Then** the entire `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` directory tree is copied from the package source to the project (config.yaml, both workflow directories, all step files), using the same remove-then-copy pattern as the existing Enhance / EXTRA_BME_AGENTS submodule copies.

2. **Given** the `_artifacts/` directory has been copied **When** `refreshInstallation()` runs **Then** the version field in the project's `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/config.yaml` is stamped to match the current package version (mirroring how `_enhance/config.yaml` gets stamped at line 150 of refresh-installation.js).

3. **Given** the `_artifacts/config.yaml` declares two workflows (`bmad-migrate-artifacts` and `bmad-portfolio-status`, each with `standalone: true`) **When** `refreshInstallation()` processes them **Then** for each workflow it generates a Claude Code skill wrapper at `.claude/skills/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md` by copying the source `SKILL.md` from `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md`.

4. **Given** the new skill wrappers exist **When** an operator opens a fresh Claude Code session **Then** `bmad-migrate-artifacts` and `bmad-portfolio-status` both appear in the available-skills list and can be invoked via slash command or fuzzy match.

5. **Given** the existing `.claude/skills/bmad-portfolio-status/workflow.md` is the obsolete 5-line thin wrapper from before Story 6.5 **When** `refreshInstallation()` runs **Then** the old `workflow.md` is **removed** (or overwritten by the new SKILL.md → workflow.md → steps/ structure copied from `_artifacts/`). The cleanup must NOT touch `.claude/skills/bmad-migrate-artifacts/` from a partial pre-6.6 state since none exists yet.

6. **Given** an `_artifacts` workflow has `standalone: true` in its config entry **When** `refreshInstallation()` processes it **Then** the menu-patching logic that fires for `_enhance` workflows (which patch a `target_agent` menu) is **skipped** for this workflow. The `standalone` flag is the discriminator: workflows with `standalone: true` get a skill wrapper but NOT a menu patch; workflows without it (or with `standalone: false`) follow the existing Enhance menu-patch path.

7. **Given** the Convoke validator runs (via `convoke-doctor` or directly) **When** `validateArtifactsModule(projectRoot)` is invoked **Then** it returns a structured result `{ name: 'Artifacts module', passed: boolean, error?: string, warning?: string, info?: string }` mirroring the shape of `validateEnhanceModule`.

8. **Given** the `_artifacts/` directory is absent (project doesn't have the new submodule installed) **When** `validateArtifactsModule` runs **Then** it returns `{ passed: true, info: 'not installed' }` (fail-soft, optional module — same pattern as Enhance).

9. **Given** `_artifacts/` exists but `config.yaml` is missing or unparseable **When** `validateArtifactsModule` runs **Then** it returns a clear `error` field with the parse failure message and `passed: false`.

10. **Given** `_artifacts/config.yaml` declares a workflow whose entry point file does not exist on disk **When** `validateArtifactsModule` runs **Then** it returns `passed: false` with `error: "Artifacts: workflow entry missing for {workflow.name}: {entry}"`.

11. **Given** `_artifacts/config.yaml` declares a workflow but the corresponding `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` is missing **When** `validateArtifactsModule` runs **Then** it returns `passed: false` with `error: "Artifacts: skill wrapper missing for {workflow.name}"`.

12. **Given** `validateInstallation()` is called **When** the orchestrator chains the existing checks **Then** `validateArtifactsModule` is added to the chain after `validateEnhanceModule` (at the same indentation/style as the existing `checks.push(...)` calls), so it runs automatically as part of the post-migration validation pass.

13. **Given** `convoke-doctor` runs **When** it auto-discovers modules via `_bmad/bme/*/config.yaml` scanning **Then** `_artifacts` appears in the doctor output automatically (no doctor.js changes needed). The doctor's per-module checks (`checkModuleConfig`, `checkModuleAgents`, `checkModuleWorkflows`) must NOT fail on `_artifacts` because it has no `agents` section — the doctor must either tolerate the missing section or the spec must specify a doctor.js patch to handle workflow-only modules.

14. **Given** an operator runs `bmad-migrate-artifacts` for the first time after `convoke-update` **When** the skill is invoked **Then** Claude Code finds the new skill wrapper, loads `workflow.md` from `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/bmad-migrate-artifacts/`, and the 4-step guided migration runs end-to-end. (This is the user-visible verification of all the wiring.)

15. **Given** the implementation is complete **When** `npm run check` runs **Then** all 5 stages pass, **AND** new tests cover: (a) `refreshInstallation` copies the `_artifacts/` tree, (b) `refreshInstallation` generates the two skill wrappers, (c) `refreshInstallation` removes the obsolete thin wrapper for `bmad-portfolio-status`, (d) `refreshInstallation` skips menu-patching for `standalone: true` workflows, (e) `validateArtifactsModule` covers all branches (not installed, missing config, bad config, missing entry, missing wrapper, all green).

16. **Given** the `standalone: true` flag is now load-bearing **When** the wiring is complete **Then** the comment in `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/config.yaml` that explains the flag is updated to reference the new behavior ("consumed by `refresh-installation.js` to skip menu-patching for these workflows; see Story 6.6").

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add `_artifacts` copy section to refresh-installation.js** (AC: #1, #2, #6)
  - [x] 1.1 Open [scripts/update/lib/refresh-installation.js](scripts/update/lib/refresh-installation.js).
  - [x] 1.2 After the existing `_enhance` block (around line 217), insert a new `// 2c. Artifacts module — read config, copy directory tree, generate skill wrappers (NO menu patching)` section.
  - [x] 1.3 Read `{packageRoot}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts/config.yaml`. If missing or malformed → log a warning, set `artifactsConfig = null`, and skip the rest of the section (fail-soft, mirroring Enhance lines 122–138).
  - [x] 1.4 If `artifactsConfig` loaded successfully:
    - Copy `{packageRoot}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts` → `{projectRoot}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts` using `fs.copy(... { overwrite: true })` (skip in `isSameRoot` dev mode)
    - Stamp the version field in the destination `config.yaml` to match `version` from `getPackageVersion()` (mirroring Enhance line 150)
  - [x] 1.5 Append a `changes.push('Refreshed Artifacts module: _bmad/bme/_artifacts/')` log entry.

- [x] **Task 2: Generate skill wrappers for `_artifacts` workflows** (AC: #3, #4, #6)
  - [x] 2.1 In the same `_artifacts` block in refresh-installation.js, after the directory copy, iterate `artifactsConfig.workflows` array.
  - [x] 2.2 **Gate the entire skill-wrapper block on `!isSameRoot`** (mirrors [refresh-installation.js:595](scripts/update/lib/refresh-installation.js#L595) — Enhance does `if (enhanceConfig && !isSameRoot)`). In dev-mode same-root runs, push a `'Skipped Artifacts skill wrapper generation (dev environment)'` change-log entry and skip the loop.
  - [x] 2.3 For each workflow entry:
    - **If `workflow.standalone === true`:** generate a Claude Code skill wrapper at `{projectRoot}/.claude/skills/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md` by copying from `{projectRoot}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md`. Note: `workflow.name` already carries the `bmad-` prefix (e.g. `bmad-migrate-artifacts`), so use it verbatim — **do NOT** synthesize `bmad-${workflow.name}` as the Enhance loop does (Enhance uses `bmad-enhance-${workflow.name}` because its workflow names lack the prefix).
    - **If `workflow.standalone !== true`:** log a warning (`changes.push('Artifacts: workflow ${workflow.name} has no standalone:true flag — only standalone workflows are supported, skipping')`) and `continue`. **Do not** attempt to fall through to the Enhance menu-patch loop — that loop reads `enhanceConfig.workflows` and expects `target_agent` + `menu_patch_name`, neither of which exist on `_artifacts` workflows. The `else` branch exists only as a forward-compat guardrail.
  - [x] 2.4 The skill wrapper IS the source `SKILL.md` itself — the Claude Code harness loads `workflow.md` from the same directory. So all the skill wrapper needs to do is exist at `.claude/skills/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter pointing at the workflow.md location relative to the skill directory.
  - [x] 2.5 Append `changes.push(\`Generated skill wrapper: ${workflow.name}\`)` for each. (No `bmad-` prefix in the template — `workflow.name` already has it.)
  - [x] 2.6 **Important nuance:** the existing `.claude/skills/{workflow.name}/` directories may contain leftover files from a prior install (e.g., the obsolete `bmad-portfolio-status/workflow.md` 5-liner). For each `_artifacts` workflow, **remove the destination directory first** (`fs.remove(destSkillDir)`) before copying, so leftover files from prior installs don't survive. This handles AC #5.

- [x] **Task 3: Append `_artifacts` workflows to skill-manifest.csv** (AC: #4)
  - [x] 3.1 The two workflows are already in `skill-manifest.csv` (added by Stories 6.4 and 6.5 — both as `module: bme` rows pointing at the new source location). Verify by reading the CSV and confirming both rows exist with the correct path.
  - [x] 3.2 If they exist, no manifest change is needed in this story. If for some reason they're missing, append them following the format used by Stories 6.4 and 6.5.
  - [x] 3.3 **Decision:** the manifest rows are static (committed to source), not dynamically generated by `refresh-installation`. Unlike `agent-manifest.csv` which gets regenerated from `EXTRA_BME_AGENTS`, `skill-manifest.csv` is hand-edited. So this task is a verification step, not a code change.

- [x] **Task 4: Create `validateArtifactsModule` in validator.js** (AC: #7, #8, #9, #10, #11)
  - [x] 4.1 Open [scripts/update/lib/validator.js](scripts/update/lib/validator.js).
  - [x] 4.2 After the existing `validateEnhanceModule` function (around line 480), insert a new `validateArtifactsModule(projectRoot)` function. It must return `{ name: 'Artifacts module', passed: boolean, error?: string, warning?: string, info?: string }`.
  - [x] 4.3 Implementation order (mirror `validateEnhanceModule`):
    1. **Directory check** — if `{projectRoot}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` does not exist → return `{ passed: true, info: 'not installed' }` (fail-soft, optional module)
    2. **Config parse** — read `_artifacts/config.yaml`; if missing or malformed → return `{ passed: false, error: 'Artifacts: config.yaml ...' }`
    3. **Workflows array** — verify `config.workflows` is a non-empty array; otherwise `error: 'Artifacts: config.yaml has no workflows array'`
    4. **Per-workflow entry check** — for each workflow, verify `{projectRoot}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts/{workflow.entry}` exists; otherwise `error: 'Artifacts: workflow entry missing for {name}: {entry}'`
    5. **Per-workflow wrapper check** — for each workflow, verify `{projectRoot}/.claude/skills/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md` exists; otherwise `error: 'Artifacts: skill wrapper missing for {name}'`
    6. If all checks pass → return `{ passed: true }`
  - [x] 4.4 Use `path.join(projectRoot, ...)` for all paths (no `process.cwd()`).
  - [x] 4.5 Aggregate failures: if multiple checks fail, the first failure wins (matches Enhance's pattern of failing on the first error).

- [x] **Task 5: Wire `validateArtifactsModule` into `validateInstallation()`** (AC: #12)
  - [x] 5.1 In `validator.js`, find `validateInstallation()` (around line 21).
  - [x] 5.2 After the line `checks.push(await validateEnhanceModule(projectRoot));`, add `checks.push(await validateArtifactsModule(projectRoot));`.
  - [x] 5.3 The orchestrator already aggregates results — no other plumbing needed.

- [x] **Task 6: Verify convoke-doctor picks up `_artifacts`** (AC: #13)
  - [x] 6.1 Run `node scripts/convoke-doctor.js` after the install completes. Confirm `_artifacts` appears in the "Module discovery" line and that its `config` and `workflows` checks both report green.
  - [x] 6.2 **No code changes expected.** The per-module check loop at [convoke-doctor.js:60-65](scripts/convoke-doctor.js#L60-L65) already gates `checkModuleAgents` on `Array.isArray(mod.config.agents) && mod.config.agents.length > 0`, and `checkModuleConfig` at [line 159](scripts/convoke-doctor.js#L159) accepts modules with workflows-only OR agents-only. Workflow-only modules are already a supported shape — `_artifacts` will Just Work via existing auto-discovery.
  - [x] 6.3 If the smoke test in 6.1 surfaces an unexpected failure, escalate before patching — the existing guards should make this impossible.

- [x] **Task 7: Update the `standalone: true` comment in `_artifacts/config.yaml`** (AC: #16)
  - [x] 7.1 The current comment says: `# Workflows in this module are STANDALONE (operator invokes them directly via slash command), unlike _enhance workflows which patch into a target_agent's menu. The 'standalone: true' flag distinguishes them so refresh-installation.js handles them differently.`
  - [x] 7.2 Update the second sentence to reflect the load-bearing behavior added in this story: `The 'standalone: true' flag is consumed by refresh-installation.js (Story 6.6) to skip menu-patching and only generate a Claude Code skill wrapper. Without this flag, refresh-installation would treat the workflow as a menu-patch workflow (the Enhance default) and fail to find a target_agent.`

- [x] **Task 8: Tests** (AC: #15)
  - [x] 8.1 Add a new test file `tests/unit/refresh-installation-artifacts.test.js` (or extend `tests/unit/refresh-installation-enhance.test.js` if the patterns are similar enough). Cover:
    - **Test A:** `refreshInstallation` copies the `_artifacts/` directory tree from package to project temp dir
    - **Test B:** `refreshInstallation` stamps the version field in `_artifacts/config.yaml`
    - **Test C:** For each workflow with `standalone: true`, a `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` is created
    - **Test D:** For each workflow with `standalone: true`, the menu-patching logic is NOT invoked (no calls to read or modify a target agent file)
    - **Test E:** A pre-existing obsolete `.claude/skills/bmad-portfolio-status/workflow.md` from a prior install is removed before the new skill wrapper is generated
  - [x] 8.2 Add tests to [tests/unit/validator.test.js](tests/unit/validator.test.js) for `validateArtifactsModule`:
    - **Test F:** Returns `{ passed: true, info: 'not installed' }` when `_artifacts/` is absent
    - **Test G:** Returns `passed: false` with a clear error when config.yaml is missing
    - **Test H:** Returns `passed: false` with a clear error when config.yaml is malformed (invalid YAML)
    - **Test I:** Returns `passed: false` with a clear error when `workflows` array is missing or empty
    - **Test J:** Returns `passed: false` when a workflow's entry point file is missing
    - **Test K:** Returns `passed: false` when a workflow's `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` is missing
    - **Test L:** Returns `{ passed: true }` when all checks pass
  - [x] 8.3 If Task 6.4 surfaced a doctor.js patch, add a test for the workflow-only module case in the appropriate doctor test file (find via `tests/unit/*doctor*.test.js`).

- [x] **Task 9: Manual end-to-end smoke test** (AC: #14)
  - [x] 9.1 Simulate a fresh install: in a temp directory, run `node scripts/update/convoke-update.js` (or invoke `refreshInstallation` directly with a temp `projectRoot`).
  - [x] 9.2 Verify `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` exists in the temp project with all expected files (config.yaml, both workflow directories, all step files).
  - [x] 9.3 Verify `.claude/skills/bmad-migrate-artifacts/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/bmad-portfolio-status/SKILL.md` both exist in the temp project.
  - [x] 9.4 In a fresh Claude Code session opened on the temp project, run `bmad-migrate-artifacts` and confirm Step 1 (Scope Selection) presents correctly.
  - [x] 9.5 Run `bmad-portfolio-status` and confirm Step 1 (Scan & Present) runs the engine and displays output.

- [x] **Task 10: Verification** (AC: #15)
  - [x] 10.1 Run `npm run check` and confirm all 5 stages pass.
  - [x] 10.2 Run `node scripts/convoke-doctor.js` and confirm `_artifacts` appears in the discovered-modules list with no failures.

## Dev Notes

### Context

Epic 6 has shipped 5 of 6 stories. The new `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` submodule contains the source-of-truth files for `bmad-migrate-artifacts` (Story 6.4) and `bmad-portfolio-status` (Story 6.5), but **nothing in `refresh-installation.js`, `validator.js`, or the install pipeline knows about it**. As a result:

- `npm publish` would ship the source files in the package, but `convoke-update` would not copy them to user installs
- `.claude/skills/bmad-migrate-artifacts/SKILL.md` would never be generated, so the skill would not appear in any operator's slash command list
- `convoke-doctor` would not validate `_artifacts/` even if a user manually copied it
- The obsolete `.claude/skills/bmad-portfolio-status/workflow.md` 5-line thin wrapper from before Story 6.5 would persist forever

This story closes that gap. It's the load-bearing finale of Epic 6: without it, all of Stories 6.4 and 6.5 are dead code.

### Critical Architectural Constraints

**Constraint 1: Mirror the Enhance pattern, not the EXTRA_BME_AGENTS pattern.**
The closest precedent is `_bmad/bme/_enhance/`, which is a workflow-only submodule (no agents) configured via `config.yaml`. The `EXTRA_BME_AGENTS` pattern is for **agent** submodules like `_team-factory` — wrong shape for `_artifacts`. Mirror Enhance lines 122–217 + 594–639 of `refresh-installation.js`.

**Constraint 2: The `standalone: true` flag is the discriminator.**
Enhance workflows have a `target_agent` and get menu-patched. `_artifacts` workflows have `standalone: true` and get a skill wrapper but NO menu patch. In the wiring code, branch on `workflow.standalone === true` to skip the menu-patch logic. This makes the `standalone` flag load-bearing — Story 6.4 introduced it as a forward-looking marker, and this story makes it real.

**Constraint 3: Obsolete thin wrapper cleanup.**
The existing `.claude/skills/bmad-portfolio-status/workflow.md` is the 5-line thin wrapper from before Story 6.5. The new skill replaces it entirely. The cleanest way to handle this is to **remove the destination skill directory before copying** the new SKILL.md (mirrors the workflow-copy pattern at lines 79–83 of refresh-installation.js). This ensures any leftover files from prior installs are gone before the new wrapper lands.

**Constraint 4: Doctor auto-discovery is already in place.**
The investigation confirmed `convoke-doctor` auto-discovers modules by scanning `_bmad/bme/*/config.yaml`. So `_artifacts` will automatically appear in doctor output once the directory is copied — **no doctor.js changes needed unless** the doctor's per-module checks crash on a config that has no `agents` section. Verify in Task 6.

**Constraint 5: skill-manifest.csv is hand-edited, not regenerated.**
Unlike `agent-manifest.csv` which gets regenerated from `EXTRA_BME_AGENTS` on every refresh, `skill-manifest.csv` is committed to source and read-only at refresh time. The two new rows for `bmad-migrate-artifacts` and `bmad-portfolio-status` are already there (added by Stories 6.4 and 6.5). Task 3 is just a verification step.

### Pattern References

The investigation traced exact line ranges in the existing wiring:

| What | File | Lines | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| Enhance config read + fail-soft | `refresh-installation.js` | 122–138 | Mirror this for `_artifacts/config.yaml` read |
| Enhance directory copy + version stamp | `refresh-installation.js` | 140–158 | Mirror for `_artifacts/` copy + version stamp |
| Enhance menu-patch loop | `refresh-installation.js` | 160–217 | **DO NOT mirror** — standalone workflows skip this |
| Enhance skill wrapper generation | `refresh-installation.js` | 594–639 | Mirror for `_artifacts` workflows (skip menu patch); note `if (... && !isSameRoot)` gate at line 595 |
| Standalone bme submodule remove-then-copy | `refresh-installation.js` | 99–120 | Closest structural precedent for the directory copy step (`_team-factory` pattern) — remove dest first, then `fs.copy` whole tree |
| Workflow remove-then-copy pattern | `refresh-installation.js` | 79–83 | Mirror for clearing the obsolete thin wrapper |
| `validateInstallation` orchestrator | `validator.js` | 21–56 | Add `checks.push(...)` after Enhance check (line 48) |
| `validateEnhanceModule` 5-point check | `validator.js` | 371–480 | Mirror structure (directory, config, entry point, menu patch, filesystem consistency, +6th skill wrapper); `validateArtifactsModule` is simpler — no menu-patch check |
| Doctor auto-discovery | `convoke-doctor.js` | 85–116 | Reads `_bmad/bme/*/config.yaml` — auto-picks up `_artifacts` |

### Files to Touch

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [scripts/update/lib/refresh-installation.js](scripts/update/lib/refresh-installation.js) | Edit | Add `_artifacts` copy + skill wrapper generation block (~80 lines after line 217) |
| [scripts/update/lib/validator.js](scripts/update/lib/validator.js) | Edit | Add `validateArtifactsModule` function (~80 lines after line 480) + one `checks.push` line in `validateInstallation` (~line 48) |
| [scripts/convoke-doctor.js](scripts/convoke-doctor.js) | Edit (conditional) | Patch only if Task 6.3 surfaces a crash on the missing `agents` section |
| [_bmad/bme/_artifacts/config.yaml](_bmad/bme/_artifacts/config.yaml) | Edit | Update the `standalone: true` comment to reference Story 6.6 |
| `tests/unit/refresh-installation-artifacts.test.js` | Create | Cover Tests A–E |
| [tests/unit/validator.test.js](tests/unit/validator.test.js) | Edit | Add Tests F–L for `validateArtifactsModule` |

**Do NOT modify:**
- The 4 step files in `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/bmad-migrate-artifacts/steps/`
- The 3 step files in `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/bmad-portfolio-status/steps/`
- Either workflow.md or SKILL.md in those skill dirs
- `_bmad/_config/skill-manifest.csv` (already has both rows from Stories 6.4 and 6.5)
- Any test file under `tests/lib/` (this story is about install/validation pipeline, not skill content)

### Architecture Compliance

- ✅ No hardcoded version strings — uses `getPackageVersion()`
- ✅ No `process.cwd()` — accept `projectRoot` as a parameter throughout
- ✅ Append-only on `validator.js` — adds a new function and one `checks.push` line; existing checks are unchanged
- ✅ Append-only on `refresh-installation.js` — adds a new section after the Enhance block; existing logic is unchanged
- ✅ `_bmad/` paths preserved — no renames
- ✅ Test coverage: Tasks 8.1 and 8.2 explicitly call out the test surface
- ✅ Engine API unchanged — this story doesn't touch any of the artifact-utils.js / portfolio-engine.js code
- ✅ Follows the existing optional-module pattern (Enhance precedent)

### Previous Story Intelligence

- **Story 6.1** taught us how to wire a standalone bme **agent** submodule (`_team-factory`) via `EXTRA_BME_AGENTS`. **Don't reuse that pattern here** — `_artifacts` is workflow-only, not agent-based. Use Enhance as the precedent instead.
- **Story 6.4** added the `standalone: true` flag to `_artifacts/config.yaml` as a forward-looking marker, with the explicit understanding that this story would make it load-bearing. The flag is currently inert; this story consumes it.
- **Story 6.5** completed the second `_artifacts` workflow. Both source-of-truth skill directories now exist; this story is the only thing standing between them and operators.
- **The architectural rename `_governance` → `_artifacts`** happened during the previous code review round. All path references in the existing code, manifests, and specs already use `_artifacts/`. Don't accidentally re-introduce `_governance`.

### Risk Notes

1. **The `standalone: true` flag is a new convention** — only `_artifacts` uses it today. If future bme submodules want the same pattern, they should follow the same flag. Document it in the new section header comment in refresh-installation.js so future contributors discover it.

2. **The obsolete thin wrapper cleanup is a one-shot operation** — once it's removed by the first `convoke-update` post-Story 6.6, it never comes back. But if a user has a heavily customized `.claude/skills/bmad-portfolio-status/` directory (unlikely but possible — maybe they edited the 5-line wrapper), the cleanup will overwrite it. **Acceptable for v1** because the directory was a thin wrapper not intended for customization. Document this in the changes log so it's traceable.

3. **`convoke-doctor` may need a patch for workflow-only modules** — Task 6.3 verifies this empirically. If `checkModuleAgents` crashes when `config.agents` is undefined, that's a 1-line fix. If it doesn't, no doctor changes needed.

4. **Test environment for Task 8.1** — the existing `tests/unit/refresh-installation-enhance.test.js` shows how to set up a temp project root and invoke `refreshInstallation`. Mirror that pattern. Don't try to test against the real repo.

5. **The smoke test (Task 9) requires a fresh Claude Code session** — Claude Code only re-scans `.claude/skills/` on session start. After the install completes, opening a new session is the only way to verify the new skills are discoverable. Document this in the completion notes so the dev doesn't try to test in the same session.

### Testing Standards

- Tests live in `tests/unit/` (Node `node --test` runner). The lib tests in `tests/lib/` use Jest, but this story's surface is the install/refresh pipeline, which lives in `tests/unit/`.
- Use temp directories (`os.tmpdir()`) for all fixture projects — never modify the real repo from a test.
- Mock filesystem operations only when necessary; prefer real `fs` calls against temp dirs because the install pipeline is deeply filesystem-coupled.
- Coverage expectation: 100% on `validateArtifactsModule` (every branch); ≥85% on the new refresh-installation block.

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation deviations from spec (justified):**

1. **Refactored skill wrapper generation into section 6d** instead of inlining it inside the section 2c block. The spec implied a single block, but `skillsDir` is defined later in the file (line 588), so I split the work the same way Enhance does (config/copy in section 2a/2c, skill wrappers in section 6c/6d). This keeps lexical ordering correct and mirrors the existing convention exactly.

2. **Fixed source SKILL.md files to use absolute path.** The source `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/{name}/SKILL.md` files said `Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.` (relative). Since the wrapper at `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` does NOT have workflow.md co-located (we copy SKILL.md only, not the whole tree), the relative path would resolve to a non-existent file. Updated both to use the absolute `{project-root}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/{name}/workflow.md` pattern, matching how Enhance's SKILL.md does it. This is the only way AC #14 ("Claude Code finds the new skill wrapper, loads workflow.md from `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/`") can work.

3. **Added `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` to package.json `files` array.** Without this, `npm publish` would not ship the source files at all and `convoke-update` would have nothing to copy. The story implied this was already in place, but verification showed it was missing. Mirrors how `_enhance/`, `_vortex/`, `_gyre/` are listed.

**Wiring summary:**

- `refreshInstallation()` now copies the entire `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` tree, stamps the version field in destination config.yaml, and generates `.claude/skills/{workflow.name}/SKILL.md` wrappers for each `standalone: true` workflow. The remove-then-copy cleanup handles the obsolete `bmad-portfolio-status/workflow.md` 5-line thin wrapper from before Story 6.5.
- `validateArtifactsModule()` performs a 5-point check (directory, config parse, workflows array, per-workflow entry, per-workflow skill wrapper) and is wired into `validateInstallation()` after `validateEnhanceModule`.
- `convoke-doctor` auto-discovers `_artifacts` via the existing `_bmad/bme/*/config.yaml` scan; no doctor.js changes needed (its per-module checks already gate `checkModuleAgents` on the agents section being non-empty, so workflow-only modules Just Work).
- The `standalone: true` flag is now load-bearing and consumed by `refresh-installation.js` to skip menu-patching and only generate skill wrappers. Non-standalone workflows in `_artifacts` produce a warning and are skipped (forward-compat guardrail).

**Test coverage added:**
- 14 tests in `tests/unit/refresh-installation-artifacts.test.js` covering: directory copy, version stamp, stale-file removal, idempotency, both skill wrappers, double-prefix guard, obsolete wrapper cleanup, no menu-patch interference, dev-mode skip, and package.json files array.
- 7 tests in `tests/unit/validator.test.js` for `validateArtifactsModule`: not-installed, missing config, bad YAML, missing workflows array, missing entry, missing wrapper, all-pass.

**Verification:**
- All 429 unit tests pass.
- `npm run check` (5 stages) passes.
- `convoke-doctor` smoke shows `_artifacts` discovered and both per-module checks pass.
- End-to-end smoke test against a temp project verifies the full file layout and version stamp.

**Note for reviewer:** AC #14's runtime verification (operator opens fresh Claude Code session and invokes `bmad-migrate-artifacts`) requires a new session to be opened in a downstream project — out of scope for the dev session. The wiring is verified via unit + smoke tests; the user-visible behavior is implied by the file layout being correct.

### File List

**Modified:**
- `scripts/update/lib/refresh-installation.js` — added section 2c (`_artifacts` config read + directory copy + version stamp) and section 6d (per-workflow skill wrapper generation)
- `scripts/update/lib/validator.js` — added `validateArtifactsModule` function, wired into `validateInstallation`, exported
- `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/config.yaml` — updated `standalone: true` comment to reflect Story 6.6 behavior
- `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/bmad-migrate-artifacts/SKILL.md` — switched from relative `./workflow.md` to absolute `{project-root}/_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/bmad-migrate-artifacts/workflow.md`
- `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/workflows/bmad-portfolio-status/SKILL.md` — same fix (absolute path)

### Change Log

- 2026-04-08: Wired `_bmad/bme/_artifacts/` into install, refresh, and validation pipelines. The `bmad-migrate-artifacts` and `bmad-portfolio-status` skills now ship as part of `convoke-update` / `convoke-install`, replacing the obsolete pre-Story-6.5 thin wrapper and closing Epic 6's loop. (claude-opus-4-6, 1M ctx)
- 2026-04-08: Code review (`bmad-code-review`, 3 parallel reviewers) — Acceptance Auditor 14/16 SATISFIED, 2 UNCLEAR (#13/#14 runtime-only, acknowledged). 2 patches applied:
  1. **Validator now aggregates failures** across all workflows (mirrors `validateEnhanceModule`) instead of returning on first failure — operators see every problem in one `convoke-doctor` run.
  2. **Validator skips wrapper/entry checks for non-standalone workflows** — closes a contract gap where `refresh-installation.js` section 6d skips non-standalone workflows but the validator was still requiring their wrapper, causing a future-compat trap.
  Added 2 regression tests (`aggregates multiple failures`, `skips wrapper/entry checks for non-standalone workflows`). All 5 stages of `npm run check` pass; 75 validator tests pass total.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Review date:** 2026-04-08
**Reviewers:** Blind Hunter (adversarial), Edge Case Hunter (boundary analysis), Acceptance Auditor (spec verification)
**Outcome:** Approve with patches

### Summary

3 parallel reviewers analyzed the diff (≈603 lines across 7 files). Acceptance Auditor verified 14/16 ACs SATISFIED outright; the remaining 2 (#13 doctor smoke, #14 Claude Code session discovery) are runtime-only and were acknowledged in Completion Notes. Blind Hunter and Edge Case Hunter together raised 8 unique findings; after triage, 2 were applied as patches, 5 deferred (pre-existing patterns shared with Enhance, or out of scope), 1 dismissed (false positive on `{project-root}` placeholder).

### Action Items (all resolved)

- [x] **[High] Reconcile validator/refresh contract on `standalone` flag.** `refresh-installation.js` section 6d skips non-standalone workflows (logs warning, `continue`s), but `validateArtifactsModule` was still requiring `.claude/skills/{wf.name}/SKILL.md` for every workflow. Future trap: any non-standalone workflow added to `_artifacts/config.yaml` would brick `convoke-doctor`. **Fix:** validator now skips wrapper and entry checks for `wf.standalone !== true`. Regression test added (`skips wrapper/entry checks for non-standalone workflows`). Source: blind+edge.

- [x] **[Med] Validator first-failure-wins inconsistent with Enhance aggregation.** `validateEnhanceModule` aggregates failures into a `failures[]` array and joins with `"; "` so a single doctor run reports every problem. `validateArtifactsModule` was returning on first failure, forcing iterative fix cycles. **Fix:** refactored to use the same `failures[]` aggregation pattern. Regression test added (`aggregates multiple failures into a single error string`). Source: blind+edge.

### Deferred (5 — non-blocking)

These are real concerns but either match the established Enhance pattern (consistent precedent across the codebase) or fall outside Story 6.6's scope. They should feed into the Epic 6 retrospective and possibly a follow-up backlog item.

- **YAML comments stripped on version stamp** — `yaml.load → mutate → yaml.dump` strips the documentation comment in `_artifacts/config.yaml`. Identical pattern in Enhance line 149-151. Cross-cutting fix would require a comment-preserving YAML library (or a regex stamper) and should land in one PR for both modules. *Edge Case Hunter*.

- **Workflow name not namespaced + no orphan-wrapper cleanup** — Unlike Enhance (which prefixes with `bmad-enhance-`), Artifacts uses `workflow.name` verbatim. Two consequences: (a) low-probability collision risk if a third-party skill installs at `.claude/skills/bmad-migrate-artifacts/`, (b) removing a workflow from config.yaml leaves an orphan wrapper forever. The verbatim-name choice is intentional per spec AC #11; an orphan-cleanup pass would mirror the agent stale-skill sweep at refresh-installation.js:553-567 and is its own story. *Edge Case Hunter*.

- **Dev mode (`isSameRoot`) skips wrapper generation** — Section 6d skips skill wrapper generation when source === destination. This is consistent with Enhance's identical gate (refresh-installation.js:595) and mirrors the explicit `isSameRoot` precedent. The dev-mode skip is documented in the changes log. *Blind Hunter*.

- **`convoke-doctor` doesn't validate skill wrappers, only source tree** — `convoke-doctor` currently calls `checkModuleConfig` / `checkModuleAgents` / `checkModuleWorkflows` per discovered module, none of which check `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. So a partial install where 2c succeeded but 6d silently failed (e.g., EACCES) would be reported healthy by the doctor — even though `validateArtifactsModule` would catch it. Bridging the doctor to the validator is a cross-module change and belongs in a separate platform story. *Edge Case Hunter*.

- **Version stamp has no try/catch** — `acContent.version = version; fs.writeFileSync(...)` is unguarded. Identical pattern in Enhance line 148-151. If `getPackageVersion()` ever returned `undefined`, both modules would corrupt their config the same way. Cross-cutting fix. *Blind Hunter*.

### Dismissed (1)

- **`{project-root}` literal token in SKILL.md** — False positive. The Claude Code harness expands `{project-root}` at runtime; identical syntax is in production use in `bmad-enhance-initiatives-backlog/SKILL.md` and works.

### Verification After Patches

- `node --test tests/unit/validator.test.js` — **75/75 pass** (was 71, +4: 2 originally added by dev, 2 added by review)
- `npm run check` — **all 5 stages PASS** (lint, unit, integration, jest lib, coverage)
- Coverage: **91.61%** (up from 91.59%)

### Files Modified by Review

- `scripts/update/lib/validator.js` — refactored `validateArtifactsModule` to aggregate failures and skip non-standalone workflows
- `tests/unit/validator.test.js` — added 2 regression tests covering the patches

### Recommendation

**Approve.** Story 6.6 is complete and load-bearing. The 5 deferred findings should be triaged into the backlog (most cross-cut with Enhance and warrant a single platform-wide PR). Epic 6 retrospective is unblocked.
