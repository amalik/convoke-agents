# Document Alignment Analysis

**Question:** After pivoting from custom orchestration to agent enhancement, which documents need updating?

**Answer:** Only **2 documents** critically need updates. The rest are either:
- ✅ Already updated
- 📚 Historical reference (intentionally frozen)
- 🔮 Future planning (not yet relevant)

---

## Document Status Summary

### ✅ ALIGNED - No Action Needed (17 documents)

#### Core Decision Documents (Updated)
1. **architectural-decision-record.md** ✅ **UPDATED to v1.4.0**
2. **phase-0-implementation-guide.md** ✅ **NEW - Complete guide**
3. **framework-deep-dive-analysis.md** ✅ **NEW - Analysis**
4. **phase-0-alternative-agent-integration.md** ✅ **NEW - Comparison**
5. **README.md** ✅ **UPDATED**
6. **PIVOT-SUMMARY-2026-02-07.md** ✅ **NEW - Summary**

#### Historical Reference Documents (Intentionally Frozen)
7. **brainstorming-session-2026-02-05.md** 📚 **Historical snapshot** - Explored 100 patterns on 2026-02-05, led to pivot decision
8. **orchestration-patterns-catalog.md** 📚 **Pattern library** - Permanent reference, not implementation plan
9. **architectural-decision-framework.md** 📚 **Framework** - 7 dimensions used for analysis, timeless
10. **llm-agnostic-architecture.md** 📚 **Principle doc** - Still valid (capabilities vs skills)
11. **architectural-comparison-quint-vs-bmad-first.md** 📚 **Option analysis** - Historical comparison (Options 1 vs 2)
12. **greenfield-architecture-analysis.md** 📚 **Option 3 analysis** - Historical, shows why not chosen
13. **technical-deep-dive-analysis.md** 📚 **50K word analysis** - Deep framework analysis, still valid

15. **product-brief-Convoke-2026-02-01.md** 📚 **Vision doc** - Product vision unchanged

#### Future Planning Documents (Not Yet Relevant)
16. **baseartifact-contract-spec.md** 🔮 **Phase 1** - Contract foundation (Weeks 4-7), no changes needed yet
17. **align-command-prototype.md** 🔮 **Phase 2** - Quint integration (Weeks 8-9), no changes needed yet
18. **executive-summary-presentation.md** 🔮 **Stakeholder doc** - For presentations, can update later if needed
19. **phase-0-workflow-map.md** 📚 **Superseded** - Original orchestration plan, kept as historical reference

### ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE - Action Required (2 documents)

20. **integration-roadmap.md** ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Phase 0 tasks still reference 1,800 LOC custom orchestration
21. **alignment-summary.md** ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - LOC breakdown still shows old estimates

---

## Detailed Analysis

### ⚠️ Documents That Need Updates

#### 1. integration-roadmap.md (CRITICAL)

**Current State:** Phase 0 section describes custom orchestration engine tasks
- Task 0.1: Capability Discovery (200 LOC)
- Task 0.2: Step Loading (300 LOC)
- Task 0.3: Orchestration Glue (300 LOC)
- Task 0.4: Execution Tracing (250 LOC)
- Tasks 0.5-0.8: DesignOS/AgentOS stubs
- Total: 1,800 LOC across 12 tasks

**Needs:** Replace Phase 0 tasks with agent enhancement tasks
- Week 1 Tasks: Emma + Wade agents
- Week 2 Tasks: Quinn + Stan agents
- Week 3 Tasks: Integration + decision gate
- Total: 500 LOC across 6 tasks

**Impact if Not Updated:** Developers following roadmap will build wrong things

**Recommendation:** ✅ **UPDATE NOW** (before starting implementation)

---

#### 2. alignment-summary.md (MEDIUM)

**Current State:** LOC breakdown shows:
- Phase 0: 1,800 LOC (orchestration engine)
- Phase 2: +500 LOC (Quint adapter)
- Total: 2,300 LOC

**Needs:** Update LOC breakdown to reflect agent approach
- Phase 0: 500 LOC (4 agents)
- Phase 2: +500 LOC (Quint adapter - unchanged)
- Total: 1,000 LOC

**Impact if Not Updated:** LOC estimates inconsistent across documents

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **NICE TO HAVE** (not blocking implementation)

---

### ✅ Documents That DON'T Need Updates

#### Historical Reference Documents

**Why Keep Them Frozen?**

1. **brainstorming-session-2026-02-05.md**
   - Snapshot of brainstorming session that explored 100 patterns
   - Led to Phase 0 scope refinement (2026-02-06) and pivot (2026-02-07)
   - Historical artifact showing decision evolution
   - **Updating it would rewrite history** ❌

2. **orchestration-patterns-catalog.md**
   - Permanent pattern library (100 patterns across 15 families)
   - Reference material for future decisions
   - Not an implementation plan
   - **Still useful even if we don't use all patterns** ✅

3. **architectural-decision-framework.md**
   - Framework describing 7 architectural dimensions
   - Used to analyze options
   - Timeless methodology
   - **No changes needed** ✅

4. **phase-0-workflow-map.md**
   - Original custom orchestration plan (superseded)
   - Historical record of what we considered
   - Shows why we pivoted
   - **Kept as "what we didn't do" reference** ✅

**Principle:** Historical documents are snapshots in time. They show our decision evolution, not current state.

---

#### Future Planning Documents

**Why Not Update Yet?**

1. **baseartifact-contract-spec.md** (Phase 1)
   - Contract foundation not starting until Week 4
   - Agent enhancement doesn't change contract design
   - **Update when Phase 1 starts** 🔮

2. **align-command-prototype.md** (Phase 2)
   - Quint integration not starting until Week 8
   - Agent approach doesn't affect Quint sync adapter
   - **Update when Phase 2 starts** 🔮

3. **executive-summary-presentation.md**
   - Stakeholder presentation
   - Can be updated before presentations
   - Not blocking implementation
   - **Update when needed for presentations** 🔮

**Principle:** Don't update future phase documents until we reach them. Current decisions may change again.

---

## Recommendation: Minimal Updates Strategy

### Option A: Update Only Critical Documents (RECOMMENDED)

**Update Now:**
1. ✅ **integration-roadmap.md** - Phase 0 tasks (CRITICAL - blocking implementation)

**Update Later (Optional):**
2. ⏸️ **alignment-summary.md** - LOC breakdown (nice to have, not blocking)

**Don't Update:**
- 📚 Historical documents (intentionally frozen)
- 🔮 Future phase documents (update when we reach them)

**Reasoning:**
- Pivot summary document already explains all changes
- Developers will follow implementation guide (not roadmap tasks)
- Historical docs show decision evolution
- Future docs may change again before we reach them

**Effort:** 1 hour (roadmap tasks only)

---

### Option B: Update All Documents (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Update Everything:**
1. integration-roadmap.md (Phase 0 tasks)
2. alignment-summary.md (LOC breakdown)
3. executive-summary-presentation.md (update slides)
4. baseartifact-contract-spec.md (mention agent approach)
5. Rewrite historical docs to match current decision

**Reasoning:**
- Complete consistency across all documents
- No risk of confusion

**Drawbacks:**
- Rewrites history (brainstorming snapshot becomes inaccurate)
- Updates documents we haven't reached yet (may change again)
- Significant effort for minimal benefit

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### Option C: Use Pivot Summary as Single Source of Truth (SIMPLEST)

**Update Nothing:**
- Let PIVOT-SUMMARY-2026-02-07.md explain all changes
- Historical docs stay frozen
- Future docs updated when reached
- Roadmap stays old (developers use implementation guide instead)

**Reasoning:**
- Implementation guide is complete and correct
- Pivot summary cross-references all docs
- Developers won't be confused if they read pivot summary first

**Drawbacks:**
- Roadmap Phase 0 tasks don't match implementation guide
- Risk of developers following old roadmap

**Effort:** 0 hours

---

## My Recommendation: Option A (Minimal Updates)

**Update 1 document now:**
- ✅ **integration-roadmap.md** Phase 0 section

**Why?**
- Roadmap is the implementation plan
- Developers expect roadmap tasks to be current
- Takes 1 hour, eliminates confusion risk

**Don't update:**
- Historical docs (preserve decision history)
- Future docs (may change before we reach them)
- Nice-to-have docs (pivot summary explains everything)

**Total Effort:** 1 hour

---

## User Decision Guide

### If you want MAXIMUM clarity (Option A - Recommended):
✅ Update **integration-roadmap.md** Phase 0 tasks (1 hour)

**Benefits:**
- Roadmap matches implementation guide
- No confusion risk
- Minimal effort

**I can do this now if you approve.**

---

### If you want MINIMAL effort (Option C):
✅ Use **PIVOT-SUMMARY-2026-02-07.md** as single source of truth (0 hours)

**Benefits:**
- Zero additional work
- Pivot summary already explains everything

**Drawbacks:**
- Roadmap Phase 0 tasks don't match reality
- Developers must read pivot summary first

**No action needed - we're done!**

---

### If you want COMPLETE consistency (Option B - Not Recommended):
✅ Update **all 21 documents** (4-6 hours)

**Benefits:**
- Perfect consistency everywhere

**Drawbacks:**
- Rewrites history
- Updates docs not yet relevant
- Significant effort

**I can do this if you really want, but I don't recommend it.**

## Summary

**Total Documents:** 21

**Status:**
- ✅ **Already Updated:** 6 (ADR, README, implementation guide, deep-dive, pivot summary, alternative analysis)
- 📚 **Historical Reference (Frozen):** 9 (brainstorming, patterns, comparisons, vision)
- 🔮 **Future Phase (Not Yet):** 4 (contract spec, align command, presentation, superseded workflow map)
- ⚠️ **Needs Update:** 2 (roadmap Phase 0 tasks - CRITICAL, alignment summary - optional)

**Recommendation:** Update **integration-roadmap.md** only (1 hour)

**Your Choice:**
- **Option A (Recommended):** Update roadmap Phase 0 tasks (1 hour) - I can do this now
- **Option C (Simplest):** Use pivot summary as reference (0 hours) - we're done
- **Option B (Overkill):** Update everything (4-6 hours) - not recommended
