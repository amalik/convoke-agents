Convoke extends AI agents with two types of installable modules: **Teams** bring new agents for a domain, **Skills** add new capabilities to existing agents. Install them independently or combine them.

| Team | Agents | Domain |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Vortex** | 7 agents, 22 workflows | Product discovery — from user insight to evidence-based decisions |
| **Gyre** | 4 agents, 7 workflows | Production readiness — from stack detection to gap analysis |

### What's New

- **Gyre team** — 4 agents analyze your project's production readiness: detect your stack, model what "ready" looks like, find what's missing, and help you act on it
- **Team Factory** — guided workflow for creating new BMAD-compliant teams from scratch (`/bmad-team-factory`)
- **Skill Validator** — new `validateSkill()` quality gate in the update system for factory-generated skills ([development docs](docs/development.md))
- See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full release details

## Vortex — Product Discovery Team

**7 agents guide you from insight to evidence and back again — a continuous discovery loop, not a one-shot checklist**

[![Agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/agents-7-brightgreen)](docs/agents.md)
[![Workflows](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflows-22-success)](docs/agents.md)

Vortex guides you through seven discovery streams — from understanding your users to interpreting production signals — so you can make evidence-based decisions before, during, and after you build. Each stream builds on the previous one's findings, and when gaps appear, the system routes you back to fill them.

```

### What Agents Produce

Here's a sample of real output from a busy parents meal planning project — each excerpt is from the [full 7-agent journey example](_bmad-output/journey-examples/busy-parents-7-agent-journey.md).

#### Emma 🎯 Contextualize

Emma frames the right problem. Here's the Job-to-be-Done she produced:

> **Job-to-be-Done:** Eliminate the daily 5:30 PM dinner decision so I can feed my family well without the mental load of planning, shopping, and deciding under time pressure.
>
> **Riskiest Assumptions:**
> 1. Decision fatigue — not cooking skill or ingredient access — is the primary barrier to weeknight dinner success
> 2. Parents would trust and act on an externally-provided dinner suggestion rather than needing to choose themselves
> 3. "Good enough" nutrition is an acceptable standard — parents aren't seeking perfection, they're seeking relief from guilt

#### Liam 💡 Hypothesize

Liam turns problems into testable ideas. Here's one of three hypotheses he produced:

> **Hypothesis 1: The Pre-Commute Decision Eliminator**
>
> We believe that busy parents will act on a single dinner suggestion delivered at 4:00 PM within 3 minutes because the decision burden — not cooking — is their primary barrier, and an earlier intervention catches them before the anxiety spiral begins.
>
> **Riskiest Assumption:** Parents will trust and act on an automated suggestion without second-guessing. Research shows they want "someone to tell me what to make" — but "someone" may need to be a trusted person, not an algorithm.

#### Max 🧭 Systematize

Max captures what you learned and decides what to do next:

> **Recommendation: PATCH** (iterate on timing, don't pivot direction)
>
> The core hypothesis is validated. The product direction (decision elimination via single suggestion) is correct. The timing mechanism needs refinement — shift from fixed 4:00 PM delivery to adaptive delivery based on each user's observed engagement pattern.
>
> **Three Actions:**
> 1. **Implement adaptive timing** — shift the push notification to match each user's observed engagement window.
> 2. **Route to Isla for timing investigation** — qualitative research on why users engage at 3:15 PM. Is it anxiety relief, logistical planning, or habit?
> 3. **Test willingness to pay immediately** — the mechanism works, but we have no commercial validation. Run a landing page test with pricing before further product investment.

## Gyre — Production Readiness Team

**4 agents assess whether your project is ready to ship — detect your stack, model what "ready" means, find what's missing, and refine together**

[![Agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/agents-4-brightgreen)](docs/agents.md)
[![Workflows](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflows-7-success)](docs/agents.md)

Most teams ship to production without knowing if they're actually ready — missing SLOs, incomplete observability, unreviewed deployment strategies. Gyre analyzes your project's filesystem, builds a capabilities model tailored to your specific tech stack, and surfaces what's absent. No generic checklists — every finding is contextual to your project.

```
                    4 Agents · 4 Contracts

  ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐

```

*Linear pipeline with a feedback loop. Coach amendments feed back to Atlas — the model improves with every review.*

| Agent | Role | What they do |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Scout** 🔎 | Detect | Scan filesystem artifacts to classify your tech stack — language, containers, CI/CD, observability, cloud provider |
| **Atlas** 📐 | Model | Generate a capabilities manifest using industry standards (DORA, OpenTelemetry, Google PRR) and web search |
| **Lens** 🔬 | Analyze | Compare capabilities against what actually exists — surface absences, compound risks, severity-prioritized findings |
| **Coach** 🏋️ | Review | Walk through findings conversationally — amend the model, capture feedback, track progress over time |

### What Gyre Produces

Gyre writes structured artifacts to `.gyre/` in your project root — safe to commit, containing technology categories only (no file contents, paths, or secrets):

- **Stack Profile** (`.gyre/stack-profile.yaml`) — classified tech stack with detection confidence
- **Capabilities Manifest** (`.gyre/capabilities.yaml`) — 20+ capabilities across observability, deployment, reliability, and security
- **Findings Report** (`.gyre/findings.yaml`) — absence-based findings tagged by severity, confidence, and source
- **Feedback Log** (`.gyre/feedback.yaml`) — team amendments that persist and improve the model over time

**Three modes:** *Crisis* (first run, full pipeline), *Anticipation* (re-analysis with cached model), *Regeneration* (fresh model rebuild).

**Delta tracking:** Run Gyre after making improvements to see what you've resolved — findings are tagged [NEW], [CARRIED], or resolved.

## Extending Convoke

### Team Factory

Create fully-wired, BMAD-compliant teams through a guided workflow — zero post-creation fixes.

```
/bmad-team-factory
```

The factory guides you through composition pattern selection (Independent or Sequential), agent scope definition with overlap detection, contract design, and integration wiring. Decision state is persisted as a spec file for resume and express mode. Output passes the same validation as native teams.

Three capabilities:
- **Create Team** — build a new team from scratch with full integration
- **Add Agent** — extend an existing team with a new agent
- **Add Skill** — give an existing agent a new workflow

### Enhance — Agent Skills

Skills give existing agents new workflows — installed via menu patching, not agent modification. The first skill adds RICE-scored backlog management to the PM agent:

```
                    Initiatives Backlog

  ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
  │  [T] Triage │   │  [R] Review │   │  [C] Create │
  │  Ingest new │   │   Rescore   │   │  Bootstrap  │
  │  findings   │   │  existing   │   │ from scratch│
  └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘

  │   RICE-scored · Categorized · Change-tracked     │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Activate from the PM agent menu or directly: `/bmad-enhance-initiatives-backlog`

The [Enhance Guide](_bmad/bme/_enhance/guides/ENHANCE-GUIDE.md) documents the complete pattern for building your own skills.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git
- Claude Code or Claude.ai

### Install

**Everything (Vortex + Gyre):**

```bash
npm install convoke-agents && npx -p convoke-agents convoke-install
```

**Vortex only:**

```bash
npm install convoke-agents && npx -p convoke-agents convoke-install-vortex
```

**Gyre only:**

```bash
npm install convoke-agents && npx -p convoke-agents convoke-install-gyre
```

Something not working? Run `npx -p convoke-agents convoke-doctor` or check the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).

### Personalize

Open `_bmad/bme/_vortex/config.yaml` (or `_bmad/bme/_gyre/config.yaml`) and replace `{user}` with your name. Agents use this to personalize their interactions.

### Activate an Agent

**Claude Code (skills)**

```

**Claude Code (terminal) / Other AI assistants**

```bash
# Vortex
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/contextualization-expert.md    # Emma  🎯
# ... (see user guides for full list)

# Gyre
cat _bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/stack-detective.md               # Scout 🔎
cat _bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/model-curator.md                 # Atlas 📐

cat _bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/review-coach.md                  # Coach 🏋️
```

**Claude.ai** — Open any agent file and paste its contents into your conversation.

**How activation works:** Each agent is a markdown file containing a full persona, menu system, and workflow instructions. When Claude reads the file, it adopts that agent's expertise and presents you with an interactive menu. Pick a workflow from the menu and follow the guided steps.

### Your First 15 Minutes

1. **Personalize** — edit the config.yaml for your chosen team and replace `{user}` with your name
2. **Pick a starting point:**
   - **Vortex:** Activate Emma → select **Lean Persona** from the menu → follow the guided steps
   - **Gyre:** Activate Scout → select **Full Analysis** from the menu → walk through the pipeline
3. **Find your artifact** — outputs are saved in `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/` or `.gyre/`
4. **Follow the Compass** — each workflow ends with a routing suggestion for which agent to use next

## How It Fits with BMAD Core

Convoke handles **discovery, validation, and readiness**. BMAD Core handles **implementation**.

```
Convoke Modules                            BMAD Core
┌──────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Teams                        │          │                      │
│   Vortex (Product Discovery) │ ──────>  │ PM → Architect → Dev │
│   Gyre (Prod. Readiness)     │ <──────  │ "Let's build it"     │
│                              │          │                      │
│ Skills                       │  signals │                      │
│   Enhance (Agent Upgrades)   │ ──────>  │                      │
│                              │          │                      │
└──────────────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────┘
```

Teams and Skills are peer module types — both installable, both independent. Convoke works standalone or as an extension — no BMAD Method installation required.

## Updating

```bash
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-version          # Check current version
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-update --dry-run  # Preview changes
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-update            # Apply update (auto-backup)
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-doctor            # Diagnose issues
```

Your data in `_bmad-output/` and `.gyre/` is never touched. Automatic backups are created before every update.

> **Tip:** If `npx convoke-update` reports "Already up to date" but you know a newer version exists, npx may be serving a cached copy. Force the latest with:
> ```bash
> npx -p convoke-agents@latest convoke-update --yes
> ```
