Convoke organizes AI agents into domain-specialized teams. Each team brings deep expertise to a specific discipline — product discovery, implementation, operations, or whatever your domain requires. **Vortex**, the product discovery team, is the first. You can install teams independently or combine them.

---

## Vortex — Product Discovery Team

**7 agents guide you from insight to evidence and back again — a continuous discovery loop, not a one-shot checklist**

[![Agents](https://img.shields.io/badge/agents-7-brightgreen)](docs/agents.md)
[![Workflows](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflows-22-success)](docs/agents.md)

**Most teams skip validation and build on assumptions.**

Vortex guides you through seven discovery streams — from understanding your users to interpreting production signals — so you can make evidence-based decisions before, during, and after you build. Each stream builds on the previous one's findings, and when gaps appear, the system routes you back to fill them.

### What Agents Produce

Here's a sample of real output from a busy parents meal planning project — each excerpt is from the [full 7-agent journey example](_bmad-output/journey-examples/busy-parents-7-agent-journey.md).

#### Emma 🎯 Contextualize

Emma frames the right problem. Here's the Job-to-be-Done she produced:

> **Job-to-be-Done:** Eliminate the daily 5:30 PM dinner decision so I can feed my family well without the mental load of planning, shopping, and deciding under time pressure.
>
> **Riskiest Assumptions:**
> 1. Decision fatigue — not cooking skill or ingredient access — is the primary barrier to weeknight dinner success
> 2. Parents would trust and act on an externally-provided dinner suggestion rather than needing to choose themselves
> 3. "Good enough" nutrition is an acceptable standard — parents aren't seeking perfection, they're seeking relief from guilt

#### Liam 💡 Hypothesize

Liam turns problems into testable ideas. Here's one of three hypotheses he produced:

> **Hypothesis 1: The Pre-Commute Decision Eliminator**
>
> We believe that busy parents will act on a single dinner suggestion delivered at 4:00 PM within 3 minutes because the decision burden — not cooking — is their primary barrier, and an earlier intervention catches them before the anxiety spiral begins.
>
> **Riskiest Assumption:** Parents will trust and act on an automated suggestion without second-guessing. Research shows they want "someone to tell me what to make" — but "someone" may need to be a trusted person, not an algorithm.

#### Max 🧭 Systematize

Max captures what you learned and decides what to do next:

> **Recommendation: PATCH** (iterate on timing, don't pivot direction)
>
> The core hypothesis is validated. The product direction (decision elimination via single suggestion) is correct. The timing mechanism needs refinement — shift from fixed 4:00 PM delivery to adaptive delivery based on each user's observed engagement pattern.
>
> **Three Actions:**
> 1. **Implement adaptive timing** — shift the push notification to match each user's observed engagement window. Engineering effort: 1-2 sprints.
> 2. **Route to Isla for timing investigation** — qualitative research on why users engage at 3:15 PM. Is it anxiety relief, logistical planning, or habit?
> 3. **Test willingness to pay immediately** — the mechanism works, but we have no commercial validation. Run a landing page test with pricing before further product investment.

### Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git
- Claude Code or Claude.ai

#### Install

```bash
npm install convoke-agents && npx -p convoke-agents convoke-install-vortex
```

All 7 agents with 22 workflows are installed and ready to use. Something not working? Run `npx -p convoke-agents convoke-doctor` or check the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).

#### Personalize

Open `_bmad/bme/_vortex/config.yaml` and replace `{user}` with your name. Agents use this to personalize their interactions.

#### Activate an Agent

**Claude Code (slash commands)**

```
/bmad-agent-bme-contextualization-expert          # Emma  🎯
/bmad-agent-bme-discovery-empathy-expert          # Isla  🔍
/bmad-agent-bme-research-convergence-specialist   # Mila  🔬
/bmad-agent-bme-hypothesis-engineer               # Liam  💡

/bmad-agent-bme-learning-decision-expert           # Max   🧭
```

**Claude Code (terminal) / Other AI assistants**

```bash
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/contextualization-expert.md          # Emma  🎯
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/discovery-empathy-expert.md          # Isla  🔍
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/research-convergence-specialist.md   # Mila  🔬
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/hypothesis-engineer.md               # Liam  💡
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/lean-experiments-specialist.md       # Wade  🧪
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/production-intelligence-specialist.md # Noah  📡
cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/learning-decision-expert.md          # Max   🧭
```

**Claude.ai**

Open any agent file from `_bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/` and paste its contents into your conversation.

**How activation works:** Each agent is a markdown file containing a full persona, menu system, and workflow instructions. When Claude reads the file, it adopts that agent's expertise and presents you with an interactive menu. Pick a workflow from the menu and follow the guided steps.

#### Your First 15 Minutes

1. **Personalize** — If you haven't already, edit `_bmad/bme/_vortex/config.yaml` and replace `{user}` with your name
2. **Activate Emma** — `cat _bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/contextualization-expert.md`
3. **See the menu** — Emma presents numbered options. Select **Lean Persona** from the menu
4. **Follow the steps** — Emma walks you through 6 guided steps, asking questions at each one
5. **Find your artifact** — When done, your lean persona is saved in `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/`
6. **Follow the Compass** — At the end, Emma's Vortex Compass suggests which agent to use next based on what you learned

Each workflow ends with a Compass routing suggestion. You don't need to follow a linear path — the system guides you to whichever stream needs attention.

### Updating

```bash
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-version          # Check current version
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-update --dry-run  # Preview changes
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-update            # Apply update (auto-backup)
npx -p convoke-agents convoke-doctor            # Diagnose issues
```

Your data in `_bmad-output/` is never touched. Automatic backups are created before every update.

> **Tip:** If `npx convoke-update` reports "Already up to date" but you know a newer version exists, npx may be serving a cached copy. Force the latest with:
> ```bash
> npx -p convoke-agents@latest convoke-update --yes
> ```

See [UPDATE-GUIDE.md](UPDATE-GUIDE.md) for migration paths and troubleshooting.

### Using the Agents

Each agent can be used independently or as part of the full Vortex flow:

1. **Emma (Contextualize)** — Start here when defining a new product or problem space
2. **Isla (Empathize)** — Start here when you need to understand users better
3. **Mila (Synthesize)** — Start here when you have research to converge into a problem definition
4. **Liam (Hypothesize)** — Start here when you have a problem definition and need testable hypotheses
5. **Wade (Externalize)** — Start here when you have hypotheses ready to test
6. **Noah (Sensitize)** — Start here when experiments have graduated to production
7. **Max (Systematize)** — Start here when you have results and need to decide next steps

Max's **Vortex Navigation** workflow helps identify which stream needs attention based on evidence gaps — you don't have to follow a linear path. Every workflow ends with a **Vortex Compass** that routes you to the right next agent based on what you learned. Ten handoff contracts (HC1-HC10) ensure structured information flows between agents — see the [contracts directory](_bmad/bme/_vortex/contracts/) for details.

For detailed workflow descriptions and usage examples, see the [Agent Guide](docs/agents.md) and the individual user guides:

## How It Fits with BMAD Core

Convoke handles **discovery and validation**. BMAD Core handles **implementation**.

```
Convoke Teams                              BMAD Core
┌──────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Vortex (Product Discovery)   │ ──────>  │ PM → Architect → Dev │
│   "Should we build this?"    │          │ "Let's build it"     │
│                              │ <──────  │                      │
│ [Future teams]               │  signals │                      │
└──────────────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────┘
```

Convoke works standalone or as an extension — no BMAD Method installation required.
